    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As an experienced Office Administrator, I have a proven track record of providing administrative support to various organizations.
         I have worked as a Personal Assistant to the Head of Department at Rivoni School for The Blind, where I managed the school's 
         diary, scheduled appointments, and handled inquiries. I also have experience as a Personal Assistant to the Group CEO and 
         Administrator at Butali Financials, where I maintained the main clients list, assisted with planning and organizing, and 
         carried out other instructions given by seniors.
        In addition to my administrative skills, I have also developed proficiency in data analytics and programming through online 
        courses on Coursera and LinkedIn. I am passionate about learning new skills and applying them to improve efficiency and 
        productivity in my work. My goal is to continue to grow as a professional and contribute to the success of any organization 
        I join.
